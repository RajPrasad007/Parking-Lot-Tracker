# Parking-Lot-Tracker
There is a parking lot and it has 2 levels A and B, each level has the capacity to park 20 vehicles of any size. Level A has parking space numbered from 1-20 and level B has parking space numbered from 21-40.

# How does it work?
You are allowed to park vehicles in Level A up to spot number 20. Once all 20 spots in Level A are taken, parking in Level A will be considered full. After that, you can commence parking vehicles in Level B, with a capacity of up to 20 spots. When both Level A and Level B reach their respective full capacities of 20 spots each, the parking lot will be considered completely occupied, and no further vehicles can be parked.
